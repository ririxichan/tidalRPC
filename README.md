## App settings

App has implemented settings that you can use to disable/enable some features.

**_All changes are applied on new song!_**

- You can disable showing `Rich Presence` on discord.
- You can disable showing `App Name` (tidalRPC) on discord.
- You can disable showing `Buttons` on discord.

_Warning: macOS users need to have app in `Applications` folder to have config working properly._

### How to access it?

It's super easy! Just click on `tidalRPC` tray icon and go to `Settings` submenu!

# Why there is no Album artwork on Rich Presence?!?!
Due to Discord limitations, I'm not going to implement workaround to do it. It's very risky since discord is banning most of people that are acting as "self-bot" and it would need your Authorization token to upload assets. Due to it I don't want anyone banned using our program, it's not going to happen.
